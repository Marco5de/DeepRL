\chapter*{Abstract}
Reinforcement learning has gained popularity in recent years especially due to advances in the field of artificial intelligence.
In past years it was successfully demonstrated how reinforcement learning approaches can be applied to the task
of continuous robotic control.
In this work the Trust Region Policy Optimization algorithm is discussed as it forms the basis of Proximal Policy Optimization
algorithm.
In the replication study the Proximal Optimization algorithm is considered with the goal of reproducing some of the original results.
I was able to reproduce some of the results achieved by the original algorithm on specific environments whereas on other
environments I was unable to achieve similar results.
