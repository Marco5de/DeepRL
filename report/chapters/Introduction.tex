\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
In the past years great strides have been made in the field of machine learning.
The field of machine learning is commonly divided into further subfields including supervised and unsupervised learning.
In supervised learning a model is presented with data samples and their corresponding label.
This includes, in the most general case, tasks such as classification and regression.
The subfield of unsupervised learning contains tasks such as clustering.
However, in recent years there is an additional field with rising popularity due to advances in the field of artificial intelligence
which is reinforcement learning.
Different to the previously mentioned tasks there is no dataset in reinforcement learning, instead an agent interacts
with an environment and bases its decisions on the interaction with the environment.\\
In this replication study the main focus will be on reinforcement learning, more precisely on continuous robotic control
using policy gradient methods.
The goal is the replication of the original results achieved by the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for continuous
robotic control tasks~\cite{schulman2017ppo}.
