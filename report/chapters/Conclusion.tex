\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The goal of the project Deep Reinforcement Learning was to familiarize ourselves with the field of reinforcement learning,
investigate one algorithm in detail and replicate the results on a specific environment.
The contribution of this work is the implementation of a working Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm as was
demonstrated on the simple Pendulum-v0 environment and to some extent on the more complex AntPyBulletEnv-v0 environment.
Multiple reasons were identified why the implementation does not achieve the same results reported in~\cite{Raffin2020}.
Nevertheless, the implementation demonstrated the expected learning behaviour of the agent.
To further improve the performance of the algorithm current state-of-the-art approaches may be incorporated into the
standard Proximal Policy algorithm.
Lastly, reproducibility in regard to this replication study and science and general was discussed.
